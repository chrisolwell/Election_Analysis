# Election_Analysis
Using Python to analyze voting data
## Project Overview
Contacted by Tom and Steve to help with election results. We set out to determine: 
  -each candidate in the election
  
  -how many total votes were cast
  
  -how many votes were cast for each candidate
  
  -the percentage of the total votes cast each candidate recieved
  
  -which candidate won the election
## Tools
We used **Python 3** to analyze poll data: **elections_results.csv**

## Summary
Our analysis shows:
  -The number of votes cast was 369,711
  -Three candidates recieved votes:
    -Charles Casper Stockham
    -Diana DeGette
    -Raymon Anthony Doane
  -The votes totalled as follows:
    -*Stockham: 85,213
    -DeGette: 272,892
    -Doane: 11,606*
  -The winner was:
    -**Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8 percent of the vote.**
    
    
## Challenge Overview
The challenge was to use python to help election officials sort through a large dataset to determine who won an election. To accomplish the task we had to install software, creaate and manage a git repository, write code to loop through the .csv and count how many votes each candidate recieved, and write the results to a .txt file.
## Challenge Summary
To summarize, we accomplished this challenge, as the attached python code and the summarization of our findings above demonstrate.
